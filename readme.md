- change the form for music videos
    >take out relevant bullshit
    >and beef up band and music video detail
- update logic in edit to reflect forms change
- add in proper menu that gets you everywhere
- change error page redirect if you try to delete a band with a music video (quick fix)
- fix logic so you can delete a band with music videos
- probably some other shit...will figure out soon.
